First Steps
===========

We first must specify in which folder we keep our notes. 

We do so by setting an environment variable. On MacOS we use:

.. code-block:: sh

    export ZETTELKASTEN=/mypath/mydirectory

We can delete the environment variable with

.. code-block:: sh
    
    unset ZETTELKASTEN

The ``show`` command will show the current value of the environment variable.

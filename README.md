# Zettelkasten tools

This projects provides a simple set of tools to set up a Zettelkasten. The Zettelkasten is a method for knowledge management made popular by Niklas Luhmann.

The Zettelkasten tools support a simple yet effective system for a digital zettelkasten. Every slip (zettel)  is a simple markdown file. These markdown files might contain images or mathematical formulas.

The Zettelkasten shows the zettel files as html and provides a simple webeserver to do so. It uses flask, a markdown to html converter and bootstrap to do so in a responsive GUI.

The Zettelkasten tools provide a set of tools to manipulate the markdown files to significantly improve the handling of a big number of zettel / markdown files.

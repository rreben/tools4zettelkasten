Why zettelkasten_tools?
=======================

The Zettelkasten method as used by Niklas Luhmann is a very effective method to organize your learning, writing and thinking (see https://www.mycelium-of-knowledge.org/luhmanns-zettelkasten/ and references therein).

A digital zettelkasten can be setup with just some folders and markdown files and a good markdown editor. IMHO special database or cloud based systems are not necessary. 

zettelkasten_tools provide some tools to make handling of "markdown zettel files" easy:

- helps to keep all files with a consistent naming convention
- helps reorganizing the file hierachy
- show your zettel notes in a browser as html
